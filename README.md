# Language Cascade
This is a proof of concept module that allows a cascade of languages to work.

This module is not compatible with Drupal 9.

For more information on how the module works please see the post at:

This module contains a couple of extra elements that aren't detailed in the above post. For example, it should also work with the hreflang metadata element.
